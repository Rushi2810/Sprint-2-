# Employee Performance and Retention Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition and retention using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. By identifying key drivers of employee turnover—such as work-life balance, compensation, satisfaction, tenure, and demographics—it provides actionable insights to help organizations improve employee engagement and reduce attrition.

## Features
- **Attrition Analysis**: Identify trends across demographics, departments, and roles.
- **Satisfaction Insights**: Explore the impact of job and environment satisfaction on retention.
- **Work-Life Balance**: Assess how work-life balance influences attrition.
- **Compensation Trends**: Evaluate how income and salary hikes impact employee turnover.
- **Tenure and Promotion Trends**: Understand how tenure and promotion gaps correlate with attrition.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset**, available on Kaggle. You can download it from the following link:

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: SQL, Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Dataset**: IBM HR Analytics Dataset

## SQL Queries
The analysis involves several SQL queries, including:
- Calculating overall attrition rate.
- Attrition by department, gender, and age groups.
- Compensation analysis by roles and departments.
- Tenure and promotion trends.

## Key Insights
1. Younger employees (20-30 years) and single employees exhibit higher attrition rates.
2. Sales and Human Resources departments face significant turnover challenges.
3. Poor work-life balance strongly correlates with attrition, particularly in roles like Sales Representatives.
4. Compensation disparities in low-paying roles contribute to higher turnover.
5. Strong manager-employee relationships reduce attrition.

## Recommendations
- Implement engagement programs targeting younger and single employees.
- Adjust compensation for lower-paying roles and introduce targeted incentives.
- Improve work-life balance through flexible policies.
- Provide leadership training to strengthen manager-employee relationships.

## Future Enhancements
- Develop predictive models for attrition using machine learning.
- Incorporate real-time employee feedback to dynamically adapt retention strategies.
- Expand the analysis with additional datasets for cross-industry insights.
